# Advent of Code 2022

Hi, my name is Andrew Welch and these are my code solutions to the https://adventofcode.com/2022 written in Typescript.

I started a bit late so the first week was playing catch-up. After that I began adding tests. I hope to get the chance to go back and tidy up the first 7 days.

Thanks for reading. Merry Christmas!

## Setup

    npm install

## How to run (Days 1-7)

    cd ./<day>
    npx ts-node main.ts

## Tests (Day 8+)

As of day 8 I have added tests for each part with the example and input files. These test cases can be run using the following command:
